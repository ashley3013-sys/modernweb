            <h2>What is coding?</h2>
            <p>Coding is the process of writing instructions for computers to perform specific tasks. These instructions are written in a programming language, which is a set of rules that a computer can understand and execute. Think of it like writing a recipe, where you provide a computer with a step-by-step list of instructions to achieve a desired outcome.</p>
            <h2>What is coding for?</h2>
            <p>Coding is for communicating with computers to create software, applications, and websites by writing a set of instructions that the computer can understand and execute. It allows humans to build digital products and services, automate tasks, solve problems, and bring creative ideas to life through languages like Python, Java, and C++. </p>
            <h2>How to learn coding?</h2>
            <p>To learn coding, start by choosing a beginner-friendly language like Python, then learn the fundamentals through an online course or tutorials. Practice your skills by solving problems on platforms like HackerRank and gradually apply what you've learned by building personal projects (you can also learn coding on this website). Consistency is key, so set aside dedicated time for practice and gradually build on your skills with more complex projects over time. </p>

            <h2>Python</h2>
            <p>Python is a popular, high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its simple syntax, readability, and versatility. It supports multiple programming paradigms and is used for a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, automation, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence. Its ease of use makes it an ideal choice for beginners, but it is also powerful enough for complex tasks and large-scale projects. </p>
            <p>Python is the most popular coding language in the world.</p>

            <h2>JavaScript</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language primarily used to create interactive and dynamic content on web pages. It is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML (for structuring content) and CSS (for styling content).</p>
            <p>Brendan Eich invented JavaScript in just 10 days.</p>

            <h2>Java</h2>
            <p>Java is a popular, object-oriented programming language and a computing platform that powers billions of devices worldwide. Its key feature is "write once, run anywhere," meaning code compiled into bytecode can run on any system with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This makes Java versatile for a wide range of applications, including enterprise software, mobile apps, and web applications. </p>
            <p>The name 'Java' is inspired by Java coffee.</p>
